## Why use Libraries?

### What are libraries?

* Libraries provide collections of useful classes and functions, ready to use.
* But code MUST be CORRECT for good science, so you need a good library.


### Scientists perspective

* As a scientist you want:
    * Run experiments, demonstrate new concepts
    * To not spend too much time writing code, if its readily available.


### Developers perspective

* As a developer:
    * You need to write some code yourself (as you're doing novel science)
    * But do you write all of it?

Our job as [Craftsperson and Scholar][Craftsperson] necessitates knowledge of software engineering and science and to balance our usage of time.


### Aim for this chapter

* How to choose a library
    * Licensing, longevity, developer community, technical implementation, feature list etc.
* Working with libraries
    * Illustrating C++ concepts, not an exhaustive product specific tutorial.
