## Course Overview

### Part 1

* Using C++ in research
* Better C++
    * Reliable
    * Reproducible


### Part 2

* HPC concepts
* Shared memory parallelism - [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org)
* Distributed memory parallelism - [MPI](http://www.open-mpi.org)
* Accelerators (GPU/Thrust)


### Course Aims

* Teach how to do research with C++
* Optimise your research output
* A taster for a lot of technologies
* Not just C++ syntax, Google/Compiler could tell you that!


### Pre-requisites

* You are already doing some C++
* You are familiar with your compiler
* You are happy with the concept of classes
* You know C++ up to templates?
* You are familiar with development eg. version control
    * Git: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
