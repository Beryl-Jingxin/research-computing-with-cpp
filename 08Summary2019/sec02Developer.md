## Be a Better Developer


### Practices

* Unit testing: [Catch2][Catch2]
* Continuous Integration: [Travis][Travis] and [Appveyor][Appveyor], all my examples use it.
* Style: [KWStyle][KWStyle]
* Linting: [cppcheck][cppcheck]
* Memory checking: [valgrind][valgrind] (Linux only)

See also clang tools such as ```clang-tidy```, ```clang-format```.


### Going Forward

* Once you start C++, read 1 chapter Scott Meyers per day. 
* Then dip into it as needed.
* Start each project with good layout and good template, e.g. [CMakeTemplate][CMakeTemplate]
* For scientific computing, consider small C++ libraries, over large projects.
