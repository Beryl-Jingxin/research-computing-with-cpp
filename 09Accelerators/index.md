## Introduction to Accelerators

###Â Gamers vs Researchers

- Global entertainment industry (2016): $1800bn
- Global video-game industry (PC and console) (2016): $100bn
- Global video-game industry -- software expenditure (2016): $50bn
- US government research efforts (pre-Trump), ~$100bn
- Global HPC industry (2011): $10bn

### What is an accelerator?

* An accelerator is a piece of computing hardware that performs some function faster than is possible in software running on a general purpose CPU
    - an example is the Floating Point Unit inside a CPU that performs calculations on real numbers faster than the Arithmetic and Logic Unit
    - better performance is achieved through concurrency - the ability to perform several operations at once, in parallel
* When an accelerator is separate from the CPU it is referred to as a "hardware accelerator"


### Why would I want to use one?

* Available on many laptop, desktops, phones, and supercomputers
* Can speed-up calculations 2-20x by off-loading from CPU to GPU
* Especially good at streaming
    - 3D graphics
    - MPEG decoding
    - cryptography
