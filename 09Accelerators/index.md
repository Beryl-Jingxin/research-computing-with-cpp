## Introduction to Accelerators

### What is an accelerator?

* An accelerator is a piece of computing hardware that performs some function faster than is possible in software running on a general purpose CPU
    - an example is the Floating Point Unit inside a CPU that performs calculations on real numbers faster than the Arithmetic and Logic Unit
    - better performance is achieved through concurrency - the ability to perform several operations at once, in parallel
* When an accelerator is separate from the CPU it is referred to as a "hardware accelerator"


### Why would I want to use one?

* Accelerators are designed to execute domain-specific computationally intensive software code faster than a CPU
    - 3D graphics
    - MPEG decoding
    - cryptography
