## C++ in Research

### Why do Research?

* Interesting job
* Contribute to knowledge
* Develop new products


### How to do Research?

* Different methods in different fields
* So we are focussing on software driven methods
* Main point - we don't know what the end product is!


### Software Is Expensive

* Lots of Computer Science Literature
    * Book: [Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Man-month-Essays-Software-Engineering/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452507457&sr=8-1&keywords=mythical+man+month)
    * People: [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/)
* Wide gap between theory and practice
* Expensive even when you know what the end product is


### C++ Disadvantages

* Compiled language
* Perceived as difficult, error prone, wordy
* Result: It's more trouble than its worth?


### C++ Advantages

* Fast, code compiled to machine code
* Nice integration with CUDA, OpenACC, OpenCL, OpenMP, OpenMPI
* Stable, evolving standard
* Lots of libraries, Boost, Qt, VTK, ITK etc.
* Result: Good reasons to use it, or you may *have* to use it


### Ask Advice

* Before contemplating a new piece of software
    * Ask advice - [Slack Channel](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/)
    * Review libraries to use, and how easy to adopt?
    * Read [Libraries](http://development.rc.ucl.ac.uk/training/engineering/ch04packaging/01Libraries.html) section from [Software Engineering](http://development.rc.ucl.ac.uk/training/engineering/) course
    * Ask about best practices


### Maximise Your Value

* Developer time is expensive
* Your brain is your asset
* Write as little code as possible
* Focus tightly on your hypothesis

(i.e. write the minimum that produces a paper)

Don't fall into the trap "Hey, I'll write a framework for that"


### Classroom Discussion

* Who has thought about different types of development?
    * Function
    * Class
    * Module
    * Library
    * Application
    * Platform/Framework


### Types of Code

* Divide code:
    * Your algorithm
    * Testing code
    * Data analysis
    * User Interface
    * Glue code
    * Deployment code
    * Paper production


### Classroom Exercise

* Discuss suitable languages for each of the above
* No "one size fits all" solution


### Fame and Glory?

As a researcher I need:

* Reputation in a given field
    * Open-source software, helps citations
    * Smallest possible software package
* Focus on the main algorithmic content of your papers
* Usages/deployment scenarios/packaging/data-analysis all vary    

Examples: [NiftyReg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg), [matching paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260709002533), 300 citations in 5 years.


### What about Methodology?

* [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
* [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
* At the 'concept discovery' stage, too early to talk about product development


### Approach to Software

* Matt's Personal Take
    * Long path between idea, prototype and product
    * Algorithm developer, probably looking at maths/method
    * Product developer, looking at product/delivery
    * No right answer for language, methodology etc.
    * We tend to code too early, "just hacking"
    * So: for each piece of coding, take time to investigate smallest, nicely structured, simple piece of code you can write

 
### What Isn't This Course?

We are NOT suggesting that:

* C++ is the solution to all problems.
* You should write all parts of your code in C++.


### What Is This Course?

We aim to:

* Improve your C++ (and associated technologies).
* Do High Performance Computing (HPC).
* Apply it to research in a pragmatic fashion.
* You need the right tool for the job.
