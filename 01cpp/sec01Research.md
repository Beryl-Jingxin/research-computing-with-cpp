## C++ in Research

### Why do Research?

* Interesting job
* Contribute to knowledge
* Develop new products


### How to do Research?

* Different methods in different fields
* So we are focussing on software driven methods
* Main point - we don't know what the end product is!


### Software Is Expensive

* Lots of Computer Science Literature
    * Book: [Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Man-month-Essays-Software-Engineering/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452507457&sr=8-1&keywords=mythical+man+month)
    * People: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/
* Wide gap between theory and practice
* Expensive even when you know the end product - and we don't.


### C++ Disadvantages

* Compiled language.
* Perceived as difficult, error prone, wordy.
* Result: It's more trouble than its worth?


### C++ Advantages

* Fast, code compiled to machine code.
* Nice integration with CUDA, OpenACC, OpenCL, OpenMP, OpenMPI
* Stable, evolving standard
* Lots of libraries, Boost, Qt, VTK, ITK etc.
* Result: Good reasons to use it, or you may *have* to use it.


### Classroom Discussion

* Discuss types of development:
    * Function
    * Class
    * Module
    * Library
    * Application
    * Platform/Framework


### Classroom Exercise

* Provide a diagram that describes the development you are doing.


### What Isn't This Course?

We are NOT suggesting that:

* C++ is the solution to all problems.
* You should write all parts of your code in C++.


### What Is This Course?

We aim to:

* Improve your C++ (and associated technologies).
* Do High Performance Computing (HPC).
* Apply it to research in a pragmatic fashion.
* You need the right tool for the job.


### Maximise Your Value

* Developer time is expensive
* Your brain is your asset
* Write as little code as possible
* Focus tightly on your hypothesis

(i.e. write the minimum that produces a paper)

Don't fall into the trap "Hey, I'll write a framework for that".
