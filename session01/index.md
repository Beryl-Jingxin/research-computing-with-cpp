## Introduction

### Assumed Knowledge 

On [MPHYGB24][MPHYGB24] ([Gary][Gary], [Dean][Dean]) you learnt:

* Lecture 4: Compiling a library, testing debugging
* Lecture 5: Arrays
* Lecture 6: Structures, dynamically allocated arrays
* Lecture 7: Classes
* Lecture 8: Operator overloads, inheritance
* Lecture 9: Polymorphism

You should have equivalent knowledge as a pre-requisite.


### Aim for Today

* Provide a reminder of 
    * C++ concepts 
    * CMake usage 
    * Both covered on [MPHYGB24][MPHYGB24]
* Unit Testing concepts
* Unit Testing in practice

Scientific software should be as rigorous \
and reproducible as sterile lab techniques.
