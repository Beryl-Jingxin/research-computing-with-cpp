## Introduction

### Understanding Library Usage 

* Libraries provide collections of useful classes and functions, ready to use.
* As a scientist you want:
    * Run experiments, demonstrate new concepts
    * Don't want to spend too much time writing code, if its readily available.
    * But code MUST be CORRECT
* As a developer:
    * You need to write some code yourself (as you're doing novel science)
    * But do you write all of it?
    
Our job as [Craftsperson and Scholar][Craftsperson] necessitates knowledge of software engineering, and science.

### Aim for Today

* How to choose a library
    * Licensing, longevity, developer community, technical implementation, feature list
* Working with libraries
    * Illustrating C++ concepts, not exhaustive, product specific tutorial
