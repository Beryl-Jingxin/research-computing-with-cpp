## High Performance Computing Overview

### Background Reading 

* This lecture has now largely been replaced, and we move straight to Shared Memory Parallelism.
* Read:
    * [Dr. Matt Jones' Introduction to HPC][MJonesTutorial]
    * [Herb Sutter's article on why multi-core is important][SutterWTTJ]
    * [Some background history on Wikipedia][WikiPediaSuperComputer]
    * [Blaise Barney's overview of parallel computing][Blaise]

### Essential Reading

* For the exam you will need:
    * [Amdahl's law, and use it in calculations][Amdahl]
    * [Flynn's Taxonomy, and understand main catergories][Flynn]
* For tutorial's and practical work you will need:
    * Use of unix shell, and submitting jobs on a cluster
    * See [RITS][RITS]/[RSD][RSD] [training courses][training] such as "[Introduction to high performance and high throughput computing][IntroHPC]" 

### Aim

For the remainder of the course, we need to develop

* Skills to run jobs on a cluster, e.g. Legion, start [here][Legion].
* A locally installed development environment, so you can develop
* Familiarity with new technologies, OpenMP, MPI, Accelerators, Cloud, so you can make a reasoned choice
