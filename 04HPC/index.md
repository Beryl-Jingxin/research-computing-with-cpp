## High Performance Computing Overview

### Background Reading

* This section is based on background reading outside the classroom
* This will save time in the classroom for practical work
* But you do need to know this content

* Read:
    * [SUNY HPC notes]( https://www.buffalo.edu/content/www/ccr/support/training-resources/tutorials/advanced-topics--e-g--mpi--gpgpu--openmp--etc--/2011-09---parallel-programming-overview--hpc-1-/_jcr_content/par/download/file.res/briefpp-handout-2x2.pdf)
    * [Herb Sutter's "Welcome to the Jungle"](http://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle)
    * [Some background history on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer)
    * [Blaise Barney's overview of parallel computing][https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/]

### Essential Reading

* For the exam you will need:
    * [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)
    * [Flynn's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy)
* For tutorial's and practical work you will need:
    * Use of unix shell
    * Submitting jobs on a cluster
    * See [RITS HPC Training](http://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/RCPSTrainingMaterials/)
    * We'll recap this now

### Aim

For the remainder of the course, we need to develop

* Skills to run jobs on a cluster, e.g. Legion.
* A locally installed development environment, so you can develop
* Familiarity with new technologies, OpenMP, MPI, Accelerators, Cloud, so you can make a reasoned choice
