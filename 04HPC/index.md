# High Performance Computing

## Why HPC?

### What is HPC?

* HPC: High Performance Computing
    * refers to "any computational activity requiring more than a single computer to execute a task."
* From [M.Jones][MJonesTutorial]
    * "HPC requires substantially (more than an order of magnitude) more computational resources than are available on current workstations, and typically require concurrent (parallel) computation."
* So,
    * big + parallel


### Why HPC in Research?

* Its the nature of research
    * Always tackle bigger problems
    * Driving the limits of hardware and software


### Why Teach HPC?

* Read [Herb Sutter's Article][SutterWTTJ]
* All major devices have multiple cores
    * Phone ([Apple A8][AppleA8] dual core),
    * Tablet ([Apple A8][AppleA8] dual core),
    * Laptop (Apple MBP, 2.5Ghz, quad core),
    * Desktop (Apple Mac Pro, 3.5Ghz, 6-core),
* Research problems require more compute power
* Soon be at a disadvantage if you don't


### Aim for this Chapter

* Overview,
    * hardware, software,
    * buzzwords
* Basic cluster computing
* (next week, start parallel programming)
