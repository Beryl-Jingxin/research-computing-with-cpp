##Â Cloud computing and big data

### Big data

Some data requires special treatment for collection, storage, and analysis. 

The 'three vs':

- volume
- velocity
- variety

### Cloud computing

Cloud computing is an approach built around the concept of shared resources.

- dynamically add and remove computing resources as you need them.
- bring up large clusters of computing power, then shut it own just as quickly

### *X* as a service

Emergence of service oriented approaches:

- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Infrastructure as a service (SaaS)
