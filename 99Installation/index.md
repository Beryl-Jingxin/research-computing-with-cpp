Installation Instructions
=========================

Introduction
------------

This document contains instructions for installation of the packages we'll be using during the
course. You will be following the training on
your own machines, so please complete these instructions.

What we're installing
---------------------

For local programming, we'll be using the C++ language, with the CMake build tool and the Google unit testing framework.
For version control, we'll be using *Git* and the *Github* website.
For remote access to servers, we'll be using an SSH Client (Putty on Windows), and an X-Server (Exceed on Windows).
You will need to have created and set up an "ssh keypair" for yourself.
We'll also be using the Fabric remote server access scripting library for Python.
There are instructions on how to set up all of these tools for your computer here.
You'll also need a code editor.

Eduroam
-------

We will be using UCL's [eduroam](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/wireless/eduroam) service to connect
to the internet for this work.

So you should ensure you have eduroam installed and working.
