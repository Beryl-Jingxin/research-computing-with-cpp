## Parallel Programming Concepts

### Single Threaded Execution

### Multiple Threaded Execution

### Amdahl's Law

* Before we start trying to parallelise everything, consider:

### Flynn's Taxonomy

* Michael Flynn 1966 proposed the following:
    * Single Instruction Single Data (SISD): single core PC
    * Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD): GPU
    * Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD): Fault tolerance, space shuttle
    * Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD): Distributed system
