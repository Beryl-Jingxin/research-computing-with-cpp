### Exercises

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in C++.  

### Setup

You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are
 using do not have desktop computers.

We will be working on our own computers, but also on the UCL training Linux server Aristotle and on the UCL
supercomputer Legion.

We have provided [setup](installation) instructions for installing the software needed for the course on
your computer, including the software you will use to access these servers.
