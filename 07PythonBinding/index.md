## Python Binding

### Integrate C++ with Python

Useful if you want to:

- Integrate algorithms in a C++ library, with a wider Python eco-system?
- Optimise a small piece of code, but otherwise use Python

It does suit research rather well.


### Overview

The basic idea:

- Python interpreter can access functions/classes in a compiled C/C++ shared library
- Write your C/C++ function/class
- Wrap it using a suitable library/macro
- Compile
- import module into Python
