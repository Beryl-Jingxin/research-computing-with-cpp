## Construction Patterns

### Constructional Patterns

* Other methods include
    * [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)
    * [Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
    * [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)
    * See [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) book
* Also look up [Service Locator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern)
* These all work well with dependency injection
* Must also use Smart Pointers to manage lifecycles
    * i.e. automatically delete component parts
