## Installation

### Introduction

This document contains instructions for setting up an OS and installation of the packages we'll 
be using during the course. This year we are encouraging everyone to use the same OS and development 
environment (Ubuntu Desktop 18.04.03, gcc/g++ 7.4.0 and cmake 3.10) for practical work as this will be
more efficient for debugging problems, sharing code etc. A convenient way to achieve this is using 
the [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) software to run Ubuntu as a virtual machine (VM)
on your host machine which could be your laptop (preffered) or one of the Desktop@UCL machines in 
the lecture room. This is not a requirment, you are free to choose your own OS and development 
environment for practical work but the coursework code you submit will be checked and must execute on
the above specified environment.    

You will be following the training on your own machines, so please complete these instructions.
You don't need everything before lecture one: for this just see the VirtualBox and Ubuntu setup tabs 
on the left. 

### What you'll need by the end of the course

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) build tool.
* [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit testing framework.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) website - make sure to get an account.
* Some C++ libraries: [The Boost C++ library package](http://www.boost.org/), and [Eigen linear algebra library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
* A command line code editor of your choice: vim, emacs, pico, etc whatever your preference
* A code editor/IDE of your choice: we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C++ and CMake Tools extensions  

### Eduroam

We will be using UCL's [eduroam](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/wireless/eduroam) service to connect
to the internet for this work.

So you should ensure you have eduroam installed and working.
